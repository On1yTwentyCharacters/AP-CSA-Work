# 2024 Question 3

## This question is about...
 - For part A, you need to find if the word has the previous word inside the word
 - For part B, you need to use `ArrayList` to create a new arraylist with only parts of a word after an input of a word

## Struggles with this question...
 - Figuring out part b with creating a new `ArrayList` that only has the parts of words that begin with a word and appending them to the new `ArrayList`

## Prior experiences that helped...
 - Using `indexOf` and `substring()`

## What I learned by doing this question...
 - Not much?
